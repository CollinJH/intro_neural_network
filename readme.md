## simple neural network from scratch in python

neural_network_basic holds three python files <br>

Neuron, Neural Network, and Neural Network Complete <br>

neuron.py - basic implementation of a neuron class <br>

neural_network.py - implementation of a network of neurons <br>

neural_network_complete.py - implementation of a neural network <br> 
    that utilizes stochastic gradient descent for backpropogation and successfully trains on data <br>
