1. neuron.py is the implementation of a single neuron

2. neron_network.py is the implementation that builds on a single neuron

3. training a neural network

given the following measurements

Name	Weight (lb)	Height (in)	Gender
Alice	133	          65	        F
Bob	160	            72	        M
Charlie	152	        70	        M
Diana	120	          60	        F

shift data to make it easier, 135 and 66 was arbitarily chose,
should shift by the mean though


Name	Weight (minus 135)	Height (minus 66)	Gender
Alice	-2	-1	1
Bob	25	6	0
Charlie	17	4	0
Diana	-15	-6	1
